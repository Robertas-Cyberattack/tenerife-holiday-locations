The JSLint report is mostly complaining about two main issues in your code:

Use of single quotes ' instead of double quotes "
JSLint is very strict about quote styles. For example:

const loader = document.getElementById('mapLoader');


JSLint prefers:

const loader = document.getElementById("mapLoader");


This applies throughout your code wherever single quotes are used.

Single-line if without braces

if (!mapEl) return;


JSLint wants you to use braces even for single statements:

if (!mapEl) {
    return;
}
